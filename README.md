In order to apply different knowledges we have learned, in this project we've been encouraged to create our own function "printf", based on the printf function included in the standard libraries in C language.

<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
+ The function have to print the information requested in the standard output.<br>
+ It must print with different types of datas and formats.<br>
+ The function must be created without using global variables, functions and macros differents to _write, malloc, free and the variadic ones_ <br>
